                Scientists contributed: <br>
               - Andre-Marie Ampere (AMA) - Earth’s magnetism, Ampere’s Law, solenoid, electrical telegraph, static galvanometer, Ampere unit <br>
               - Michael Faraday (MF) - Father of Electricity, principles of electromagnetic induction, invent electric motor, “Electric current produces magnetic field.” <br>
               - Heinrich Rudolf Hertz (HRH) - “EM waves exist.”, radio waves (late 1880) — induction coil and receiving antenna, invented radar, photoelectric effect, Hertz frequency <br>
               - James Clerk Maxwell (JCM) - Father of Electromagnetic Theory, theory of electromagnetism, color photograph, Maxwell equations <br>
               - Hans Christian Oersted (HCO) - “Electric currents create magnetic fields.”, Oersted law, “Moving electrons can create a magnetic field.”, Oersted unit <br>
               - Ampere’s Law - magnetic force between two electrical current <br>
               - Ampere unit - measures electric current <br>
               - Electromagnetic Theory - light was electromagnetic radiation <br>
               - Oersted’s Law - steady electric current passing through a wire creates magnetic field  <br>
               - Oersted unit - magnetic-field strength <br>
                <br>
                Principles of EM wave theory <br>
                Mechanical waves - requires a medium to propagate <br>
                Light - changing electric and magnetic field that propagate outward <br>
                - Light does not require a medium, propagates at 300,000,000m/s (3 x 10^8) <br>
                Electromagnetic waves - transverse waves <br>
                - Oscillating charge accelerates, moving charge’s electric field changes <br>
                <br>
                Transverse Waves - particles move perpendicular <br>
                Electromagnetic Waves - can travel through a medium and vacuum, have the same speed = speed of light, consists of electric and magnetic fields which vibrate – making waves <br>
                wavelength ≠ frequency, energy <br>
                <br>
                Parts  <br>
                Crest - highest part  <br>
                Trough - lowest part  <br>
                Wavelength - distance between two waves  <br>
                Wave height - vertical distance between the trough and crest  <br>
                Amplitude - maximum height from its rest position  <br>
                <br>
                Equation <br>
                v = λf (v = voltage,  λ = wavelength, f = frequency)  <br>
                <br>
                ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM  <br>
                complete spectrum (continuum) of all forms of light   <br>
                wavelength ≠ frequency, energy  <br>
                Radio Waves - low energy, longest wavelengths, low frequency, FM and AM, transmit sound and picture <br>
                Microwaves - satellite communications, radars, TV transmission, microwave oven, can penetrate the Earth’s atmosphere, transmitted by an antenna  <br>
                Infrared Waves - invisible, detected as heat, night goggles, heat lamps, Frederick William Herschel   <br>
                Visible Light - human eyes can detect, ROYGBIV, Phototherapy - light in medical treatment  <br>
                Ultraviolet Waves - higher energy, tanning beds and sterilizing equipment, Vit. D, sterilization of water, identifying original banknotes  <br>
                X-Rays - Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen, high energy, used in medicine, industry, and astronomy, cause energy  <br>
                Gamma Rays - highest energy, kill living cells, radiotherapy - treat cancer, sterilization of drinking water  <br>
