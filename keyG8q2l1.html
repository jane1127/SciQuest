            <h1>Earthquakes and Faults.</h1> <br>
            <p> - energy makes the ground move, friction hold rocks together <br>
                - ground will move and earthquake will occur once friction is overcome <br>
                <br>
                Earthquake <br>
                - sudden slip on a fault, released in the form of energy <br>
                Creep <br>
                - faults/blocks move slowly to each other <br>
                Fault 
                - fracture or zone of fractures, may range in length, produce repeated displacements <br>
             - Normal - block above moved downward, hanging wall down to the footwall <br>
             - Reverse - thrust fault, upper block moves up and over, hanging wall thrust over the footwall, common in areas of compression <br>
             - Strike-Slip - blocks slide past each other, San Andreas <br>
                -    Left lateral - left block moves toward <br>
                -    Right lateral - right block moves toward <br>
                Stress - plates are pushed or pulled together <br>
             - Compression - rocks push or squeeze against one another then arise, targets the center, horizontal–crust thickens or shortens, vertical–crust thins out or break off, mountains <br>
             - Tension - rocks pull apart, plates can move farther away or a plate can move in different direction, reason why Pangaea were broken off <br>
             - Shear - templates rub each other, pushes some of the crust in different directions, can cause earthquakes <br>
             - Confining - crust compacts which makes it smaller, stress is applied to all sides of crust, cause sinkholes <br>
             <br>
